# forecast-app

> A weather forecast app built with VueJS

The VueJS code all lives within `/src`

You will need to have [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev/) and [Google](https://console.developers.google.com) API keys and set them with `process.env.DARK_SKY_KEY` and `process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` to successfully test the app.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# run unit tests
yarn run unit
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
